In the 'Search' screen, you can attempt to look for a specific call using several fields. Be sure to enter as much information as possible for a more focused search.

## Credits

A huge thanks to [this](https://www.allhandsontech.com/programming/blazor/how-to-sqlite-blazor/) tutorial which really made the foundation for this application. I mostly repurposed it for a different use and added the searching functions. 

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
