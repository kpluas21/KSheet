# KSheet

## Description

KSheet is an interactive web application made with Blazor used to log calls taken at a call center.

- This was made in an effort to save paper, trees and time!
- Allows the lead supervisors to quickly check calls 
- Enables faster searching instead of manually reading through physical sheets of paper.

In the 'Search' screen, you can attempt to look for a specific call using several fields. Be sure to enter as much information as possible for a more focused search.

## Credits

A huge thanks to [this](https://www.allhandsontech.com/programming/blazor/how-to-sqlite-blazor/) tutorial which really made the foundation for this application. I mostly repurposed it for a different use and added the searching functions.
